Drop Down Menu TODO
===================

- Add DropDownMenu.titleView to let the menu manages the title view status (up vs down)
- Add DropDownMenuDelegate.needsBackgroundTransition to let the client cancels the background alpha animation when a menu is hidden and another one is shown immediately
- Add some presentation options for DropDownMenuCell to support UI patterns commonly seen in Apple's apps
- May be make easier to customize DropDownMenuCell layout
